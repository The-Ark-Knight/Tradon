        "Engineering and construction conglomerate Larsen & Toubro (L&T) on Tuesday said it has manufactured a hydrotreating reactor for the Antonio Dovali Jaime Refinery at Salina Cruz, in Mexico.",
        "The reactor has been dispatched for Mexico from the company's A M Naik Heavy Engineering Complex at Hazira in Gujarat.",
        "\"Equipped with critical Cr-Mo-V metallurgy, the hydrotreating reactor is based on a technology developed by France-headquartered Axens. It has been manufactured at the Hazira Complex in a record 15 months,\" it said in a statement.",
        "The reactor uses hydrotreating process, which is a catalytic conversion in petroleum refining, among others, for removing impurities such as nitrogen and sulphur compounds from hydrocarbon streams.",
        "Larsen & Toubro is a USD 23 billion Indian multinational engaged in engineering, procurement, and construction projects, hi-tech manufacturing and services. It operates in over 50 countries worldwide."
