The data will be stored in a separate MongoDB Collections and the relates quarries will be designed to retrieve the data to serve to the front end. 
MongoDB API maybe used But that will limit our usage to the MongoDB Cloud Service with 500 MB usage for the whole Database.

Given the size of the operation 500 MB may not be adequate and hence an alternate method need to be created.

On an average per cycle 6 +- 2 articles are to be added after the initial testing set that are expected to be at a level.
