        "\"We are looking at Hyderabad for our GCC.. and also looking at Pune. It might take six months to one year,\" said Venu Nuguri, the managing director and CEO of the company's India unit.",
        "The center could be in either or both cities depending on the demand, he said, without giving financial details of the investment.",
        "The new GCC - a low-cost, offshore facility - will work alongside Hitachi Energy India, but will be part of a separate non-listed Indian entity of Hitachi Energy in Switzerland, Nuguri said.",
        "India's government last year rolled out incentives for green energy transition, with an aim to have 500 GW of installed capacity through non-fossil fuel sources by 2030."
